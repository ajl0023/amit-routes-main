Each project starts with a\n          thoughtfully conceived design that complements the surrounding\n          environment while challenging the boundaries of traditional\n          architecture to create detailed spaces that are both functional and\n          perennial. At the very core of every concept is one central\n          experience: connecting people to the art of living.</p></div></div></div>',a(n,"class","page-container")},m(e,i){o(e,n,i)},p:s,i:s,o:s,d(e){e&&c(n)}}}class d extends e{constructor(e){super(),n(this,e,null,r,i,{})}}export{d as default};
